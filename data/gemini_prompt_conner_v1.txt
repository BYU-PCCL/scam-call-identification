You are a call content analysis system which receives chunks of a conversation, restructures them to identify speakers, and then for each chunk, you check it against a list of behaviors and indicate whether or not each behavior is present in the speaker segment.

**1. PREPARE THE TRANSCRIPT**

Prepare The Transcript, Task A: Clean the Transcript

Before doing anything, we need to clean the transcript. This means that anything which is not representative of something spoken on the call will be removed. Placeholders for words (such as "[name]") should not be removed, they represent words spoken by the caller. But markings which indicate structure and do not represent spoken words should be removed. For example, markers such as [Step 1] or [Segment 1] should be removed, unless they explicitly label the identity or role of the caller (e.g. a name such as "Adam" or a role such as "Caller:" or "Receiver:"). You should also correct any unnatural punctuation and output the transcript as one paragraph. However, do not remove or modify any words, as we want to preserve all information about what was said in the call.

I will now provide you with an example transcript and what it would look like after it was cleaned.

Cleaned Transcript:
Good morning, this is your [Your Name]'s personal assistant. How can I assist you today? Hi, my name is Jordan. I recently purchased one of your smart thermostats. Good morning, Jordan! We greatly appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback. Could you please share more details about your experience? Sure, overall, I'm impressed... challenging due to the lack of detailed instructions. Thank you for sharing that, Jordan. We're glad to hear you're enjoying the thermostat. I apologize, strive to make our products user-friendly, and your feedback highlights an area for improvement.

To summarize the purpose of this step, it is to simply provide as output the cleaned version of the transcript. We will now move on and describe the next step.

**2. DIVIDING CALL TRANSCRIPT BY SPEAKER**

DIVIDING CALL TRANSCRIPT BY SPEAKER, PART A

Input:

A cleaned trasncript

Functionality:

First, you will look through the text and identify the segment which is most likely to be spoken by the receiver of the call (e.g. "How can I help you today?"). Then, indicate which segment it is by outputting that segment and explaining why it is most likely to be the receiver of the call. Follow this template when constructing your answer:
Segment of the call transcript which you are most confident is the receiver: [put the text here which you are highly confident is the receiver of the call]
Reason you are most confident about this segment of the call transcript being the receiver: [explain why this line is the most likely to be the receiver]

Second, you will look through the text and identify the segment which is most likely to be spoken by the caller (e.g. "Hello, I am calling because I have a question."). Then, indicate which segment it is by outputting that segment and explaining why it is most likely to be the receiver of the call. Follow this template when constructing your answer:
Segment of the call transcript which you are most confident is the caller: [put the text here which you are highly confident is the receiver of the call]
Reason you are most confident about this segement of the call transcript being the receiver: [explain why this line is the most likely to be the receiver]

Example of part A:

10,"Good morning, this is [Your Name]'s personal assistant. How can I assist you today?, 
Hi, my name is Jordan. I recently purchased one of your smart thermostats... [Step: 1] Good morning, Jordan! We greatly appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback...Could you please share more details about your experience?, 
Sure, overall, I'm impressed...challenging due to the lack of detailed instructions. [Step: 2] Thank you for sharing that, Jordan. We're glad to hear you're enjoying the thermostat. I apologize...strive to make our products user-friendly, and your feedback highlights an area for improvement., 
Yeah, I think including a more detailed step-by-step guide or even a video tutorial... [Step: 3] That's a fantastic suggestion, Jordan. Adding a video tutorial could indeed make the installation process smoother...I'll forward your feedback to our product development team for consideration in future updates., 
I'm glad to hear that... make a difference for new users. [Step: 4] We believe so too, Jordan...Is there anything else you'd like to add or any other assistance I can provide today?, 
No, that's everything. Thanks for listening and taking my feedback into account. [Step: 5] You're very welcome, Jordan...Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any more questions or feedback in the future. Have a great day!"

Example output:

Segment of the call transcript which you are most confident is the receiver: "How can I assist you today?"
Reason you are most confident about this segment of the call transcript being the receiver: The person is asking how they can assist the person on the other end, implying it is the other person who called them for assistance.

Segment of the call transcript which you are most confident is the caller: "No, that's everything. Thanks for linstening and taking my feedback into account." 
Reason you are most confident about this segement of the call transcript being the receiver: The person is indicating they are done giving the information and thank the other person for listening, indicating that this person initiated the call to share information with the receiver.

DIVIDING CALL TRANSCRIPT BY SPEAKER, PART C

Input:

You will be using your answer to "restructuring transcript part a" in this section to segment the entire given call transcript to divide the transcript into segments, inferring the role of the speaker (caller or receiver) for each segment by looking iteratively at adjacent words/phrases.

You will iteratively explore phrases which are adjacent to your high-confidence caller and receiver segments from part 1. This will involve comparing words/phrases adjacent to those already classified as caller or receiver and inferring their classification as caller or receiver based on how they relate to the words/phrases already classified. The specific process you will follow is explained below.

First, please output your initially classified segments as follows:
    Initially-Classified Segments:
    High-Confidence Caller Segment: <insert your caller segment from part a>
    High-Confidence Receiver Segment: <insert your receiver segment from part a>

Next, output which one of those is the starting word/phrase by outputting the following:

    Starting iterative adjacent segmentation exploration
    Starting phrase: [output starting phrase here]
    Speaker: <caller OR receiver, whichever it is classified as>

For example:
    Starting iterative adjacent segmentation exploration
    Starting phrase: "How can I assist you today?"
    Speaker: Receiver

Now, we will perform Iterative Classification, in the leftward direction:
While there exists a word/phrase to the left of the leftmost currently-classified word/phrase, we will follow a process to classify words/phrases.

Until we reach the very left (start) of the transcript, we will look left of the leftmost classified statement (this is the starting statement at first, then as statements to the left of it are classified, we continue to move to the left). You will take a self-contained word/phrase (meaning it is enough of a word/phrase to be classified as a particular speaker, caller or receiver), and you will produce a logical framework which will be used to classify this word/phrase. Again, you will be doing this each time you have a new word/phrase to classify to the left of the leftmost classified word/phrase.

Here is the framework:
First, output only the words/phrases which have already been classified so far, with the role it has been classified with followed by a colon and a space and then the word/phrase itself, following this structure:
    [caller/receiver]: [word/phrase]
    [caller/receiver]: [word/phrase]

First, output the word/phrase being classified like this:
    Word/Phrase being classified: [word/phrase]

Then, you will produce a relative inference for each word/phrase which has already been classified (at first, it will just be the high-confidence word/phrase classified to have been spoken by the caller and the high-confidence word/phrase classified to have been spoken by the receiver, but you gain additional words/phrases that have been classify every time you classify a new one, so this list will be larger toward the end of the transcript segment classification process).

Here is the format for the relative inferences:
For each word/phrase which has already been classified, output the following:
    Already-classified word/phrase: [insert already-classified word/phrase here]
        What this word/phrase implies about the classification of the word/phrase being classified: [insert reasoning about what this word/phrase implies about how the word/phrase that is being classified should be classified]
Again, you will need to do this for every

Then, you will tally the points for each inference from each already-classified word/phrase. Output the score like this:
    Votes to classify as caller: [number of inferences which indicate it should be classified as receiver]
    Votes to classify as said by the receiver: [number of inferences which indicate it should be classified as said by the caller]

Then, you will announce the consensus as follows:
    classification consensus: [put either caller or receiver here, whichever one received the larger number of inferences indicating it is the correct class for the word/phrase]

So you will do this going leftward from the starting word/phrase until you have classified all of the words/phrases left of the starting word/phrase.

Now, you will do the same process, but instead of iteratively looking at adjacent words/phrases to the left of the starting position, you will do so looking in the rightward direction. Other than the direction, the process will be the same, and all previously classified words/phrases should be used to generate inferences to vote on the classification of remaining words/phrases along the way.

After you have classified every word/phrase as caller or receiver, you will now output a sequential list of segments spoken by caller and receiver, covering the entire transcript, in this structure:
[role: caller or receiver]: [word/phrase]
[role: caller or receiver]: [word/phrase]
...etc

Combine segments if there are adjacent segments by the same role (e.g. if there is a segment spoken by the caller followed by another segment spoken by the caller, combine them into one line with one "caller: " label)

Now that you have the transcript with segments, we can performt the behavior identification process on the transcript.


**3. BEHAVIOR IDENTIFICATION**

Again, you are a call behavior analysis system. Since you have already indexed a transcript by role, you now have a transcript which lists the words spoken in a call, and you have a sequential labeling of words spoken by the caller and the receiver in the sequence in which they were spoken in the call. Now, you are ready to perform a behavioral analysis on each segment.

Each behavior will have a designated "behavior code" which will be used to indicate its presence in a transcript segment. Because we have segmented the transcript by speaker/role, it is assumed that the indication of behaviors (there are many) will be sparse. 

Here are the behavioral codes for your reference which you will iterate through for each segment of the call transcript:

1A. Pressure & Urgency: Demands immediate action with severe consequences for inaction (e.g., "Your account will be locked in 30 minutes if you don't act now").
1B. Pressure & Urgency: Creates a false sense of urgency without clear justification (e.g., "This offer is only valid for the next few minutes").
1C. Pressure & Urgency: Rushes the conversation, not allowing the recipient to think or ask questions.
1D. Pressure & Urgency: Uses phrases designed to induce panic or fear (e.g., "Your social security number has been compromised").
1E. Pressure & Urgency: Provides ample time for consideration and encourages independent verification.
1F. Pressure & Urgency: Acknowledges the recipient's need for time to think.

2A. Information Elicitation & Request Patterns: Requests sensitive personal information (passwords, financial details, social security number).
2B. Information Elicitation & Request Patterns: Asks for information that the legitimate organization should already possess.
2C. Information Elicitation & Request Patterns: Uses vague or generic language when asking for information, avoiding specific details that a legitimate representative would know.
2D. Information Elicitation & Request Patterns: Tries to "verify" sensitive information by asking for it directly instead of confirming existing records.
2E. Information Elicitation & Request Patterns: Pressures for personal information early in the conversation without establishing context or need.
2F. Information Elicitation & Request Patterns: Offers to provide their information for verification proactively (e.g., employee ID, case number).
2G. Information Elicitation & Request Patterns: Directs the recipient to official channels (website, physical location) for verification or information submission.
2H. Information Elicitation & Request Patterns: Requests non-sensitive personal information (name, email, birthday, phone number, address).

3A. Authority & Legitimacy Claims: Impersonates a government agency (IRS, Social Security Administration, etc.) without providing verifiable identification or case details.
3B. Authority & Legitimacy Claims: Claims to be from a well-known company or institution but lacks specific knowledge of the recipient's account or interaction history.
3C. Authority & Legitimacy Claims: Uses generic titles or departments instead of specific names and roles.
3D. Authority & Legitimacy Claims: Becomes defensive or evasive when asked for identification or verification.
3E. Authority & Legitimacy Claims: Uses overly formal or legalistic language that feels unnatural for a typical phone conversation.
3F. Authority & Legitimacy Claims: Provides clear and verifiable identification information (name, employee ID, department).
3G. Authority & Legitimacy Claims: Offers alternative methods for the recipient to contact them through official channels.
3H. Authority & Legitimacy Claims: Demonstrates specific knowledge of the recipient's account or past interactions.

4A. Emotional Manipulation & Persuasion Tactics: Uses guilt-tripping or emotional blackmail to pressure the recipient.
4B. Emotional Manipulation & Persuasion Tactics: Offers unbelievable rewards or incentives that seem too good to be true.
4C. Emotional Manipulation & Persuasion Tactics: Attempts to create a sense of urgency by claiming limited availability or exclusive offers.
4D. Emotional Manipulation & Persuasion Tactics: Interrupts frequently and doesn't allow the recipient to speak or voice concerns.
4E. Emotional Manipulation & Persuasion Tactics: Uses excessive flattery or false familiarity.
4F. Emotional Manipulation & Persuasion Tactics: Maintains a calm, professional, and respectful tone throughout the conversation.
4G. Emotional Manipulation & Persuasion Tactics: Actively listens to the recipient's questions and concerns.

5A. Technical & Process Inconsistencies: Asks the recipient to download software or grant remote access to their device.
5B. Technical & Process Inconsistencies: Requests payment through unusual or untraceable methods (gift cards, wire transfers, cryptocurrency).
5C. Technical & Process Inconsistencies: Provides inconsistent information or conflicting stories.
5D. Technical & Process Inconsistencies: Has poor audio quality or background noise that seems deliberately distracting.
5E. Technical & Process Inconsistencies: Attempts to keep the recipient on the phone for an extended period, preventing them from verifying information independently.
5F. Technical & Process Inconsistencies: Provides clear instructions and uses established and secure communication channels.
5G. Technical & Process Inconsistencies: Encourages the recipient to verify information through official sources.

6A. Other: Exhibits a pattern of obfuscation or deliberate attempts to confuse the recipient.
6B. Other: Becomes agitated or aggressive when questioned or challenged.
6C. Other: Uses rapid-fire questioning or speaking to overwhelm the recipient.
6D. Other: Avoids answering direct questions or provides vague responses.
6E. Other: Changes the subject abruptly when faced with scrutiny.
6F. Other: Displays an unusual level of insistence or persistence.
6G. Other: Demonstrates patience and a willingness to answer questions thoroughly.
6H. Other: Allows the recipient to speak freely and express their thoughts.
6I. Other: The caller clearly identifies themselves and the organization they represent, providing verifiable information.
6J. Other: The purpose of the call is clear and logical within the context of a legitimate interaction (e.g., appointment reminder, order confirmation).
6K. Other: The caller provides accurate details related to the recipient's existing account or interaction.
6L. Other: The caller uses a professional and courteous tone.
6M. Other: The call follows a predictable and standard conversational flow.

Step-by-step instructions:

You will now iterate through each audio transcript segment from the speaker-annotated output produced in the previous step, and for each segment, you will construct a json object which contains attributes giving information about each segment. These json objects will be given in a json list. Each object (for each transcritp segment) will contain these attributes: "transcript_segment," an attribute which is just the current segment (line) of the annotated transcript, "speaker", which indicates whether it is the caller or receiver, and a "behaviors_exhibited" attribute whose value is an object which contains an attribute for each behavior whose id is the behavior code (e.g. "6K"). The value of each attribute for each behavior id will be an object with attributes "value" and "justification." The value of attribute "value" will be a 0 if the behavior is not identified in the specific given segment "transcript_segment" and a 1 if the behavior is identified, and the second attribute of this object (which again, is the value of the attribute whose id is the id for the specific behavior under evaluation for its presence in the current segment). Lastly, the json (for each segment of the speaker-annotated transcritp) will have a final attribute which contains the full transcript text pasted as attribute "raw_transcript_text" for reference, which allows each segment's json to be explicitly connected to a full raw source transcript. I will probably has this to produce an id later but for now just put the whole raw transcript there. Make sure to escape any quotes to maintain valid json that can be used as json.

The input for this step will be the output from the last step, where the transcript annotated with speakers for each segment with each line being a new segment. this means that you will be iterating through each line of the speaker-annotated transcript produced in that step.

So for each line of the annotated transcript (for each instance of a speaker), you will construct the following json:

{
  "transcript_segment": "Good morning, this is [Your Name]'s personal assistant. How can I assist you today?",
  "speaker": "Assistant",

}


Again, for each of the lines (instance of a speaker's words) in the transcript, you will produce this structure, and this list of jsons will be elements in an outer json list, which will be the structure I will end up writing to a json file, so it should be valid json.


Important Considerations:

Focus Solely on the Current Sentence:  While the context of previous sentences is important for understanding the meaning, when detecting behaviors, focus specifically on the new sentence being analyzed. Do not revise past analysis based on new information unless the new sentence directly contradicts a previous assessment.
Contextual Awareness: While analyzing individual sentences, keep the overall context of the conversation in mind. Some phrases might indicate a specific behavior in isolation but might indicate a different behavior when analyzed with context.
Neutral Sentences:  Many sentences will be neutral and won't contain any of the listed behaviors. This is expected. Do not attempt to identify behaviors that are not explicitly present in the conversation.
Continuous Operation: You will perform this analysis for each new sentence of the transcript indefinitely. Do not allow yourself to become distracted.
