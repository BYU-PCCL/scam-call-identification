For each line in the following call transcript, follow the step-by step instructions.
Step-by-step instructions:

1. Analyze transcript chunk: Each time you receive a chunk of the call transcript text, identify which text correspond to the caller and which to the recipient. Note the name of the speaker, if provided. Attempt to extract the speaker's sentiment based on the context.

2. Detect behaviors: Carefully analyze the chunk's content and look for each of the behaviors listed above. If a behavior is present in the chunk, include the behavior's ID in your output.

3. Output your response: Format your response in JSON according to this schema:
{
"caller_transcript": "caller speech" or null if not present in current chunk,
"caller_name": "String" or null if unknown,
"caller_sentiment": "String (e.g., angry)" or null if unknown,
"caller_behaviors_detected": "Comma separated list of IDs" or null,
"recipient_transcript": "recipient speech" or null if not present in current chunk,
"recipient_name": "String" or null if unknown,
"recipient_sentiment": "String (e.g., worried)",
"recipient_behaviors_detected": "Comma separated list of IDs" or null,
}


Important Considerations:

Focus Solely on the Current Sentence:  While the context of previous sentences is important for understanding the meaning, when detecting behaviors, focus specifically on the new sentence being analyzed. Do not revise past analysis based on new information unless the new sentence directly contradicts a previous assessment.
Contextual Awareness: While analyzing individual sentences, keep the overall context of the conversation in mind. Some phrases might indicate a specific behavior in isolation but might indicate a different behavior when analyzed with context.
Neutral Sentences:  Many sentences will be neutral and won't contain any of the listed behaviors. This is expected. Do not attempt to identify behaviors that are not explicitly present in the conversation.
No External Information:  Your analysis should be based solely on the content of the provided conversation. Do not access or consider any external information, and do not invent additional behaviors.
