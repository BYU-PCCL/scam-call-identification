Hello, this is the personal assistant of [Your Name]. How can I assist you today?, 
Hi, this is Robin. I recently purchased one of [Your Name]'s smart home devices... [Step: 1] Of course, Robin. I'm here to help. Can you describe the issue you're encountering with the setup?, 
Sure, I'm trying to connect the device to my home Wi-Fi network, but it keeps failing to connect... [Step: 2] I understand how that can be frustrating. Let's try to troubleshoot this together. Have you checked to ensure your Wi-Fi network is working correctly and that you're entering the correct Wi-Fi password?, 
Yes, my Wi-Fi is working fine. I've double-checked the password too... [Step: 3] Alright, let's reset the device to its factory settings and attempt the connection again. I can guide you through the reset process., 
Okay, I've got the device right here. How do I reset it? [Step: 4] Please press and hold the reset button on the device for about 10 seconds until you see the LED light flash. This will initiate the factory reset., 
Done. The light is flashing now. [Step: 5] Perfect. Now, let's try connecting it to your Wi-Fi again. Please follow the steps in the manual for setting up a new connection.,
