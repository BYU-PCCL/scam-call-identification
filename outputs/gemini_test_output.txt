While nothing tastes exactly like a pineapple, here are some fruits that share similarities in flavor, texture, and/or acidity:

**Flavor/Acidity:**

*   **Mango:** Both have a sweet, tropical flavor with a tangy acidity. Some mango varieties have a resinous quality that is faintly reminiscent of pineapple.
*   **Guava:** Depending on the variety, guava can have a sweet, tart, and slightly floral flavor that shares some characteristics with pineapple.
*   **Passion Fruit:** This fruit is known for its intense sweet-tart flavor and bright acidity. It has some tropical notes in common with pineapple.
*   **Green Apples (Granny Smith):** The tartness of a green apple can mimic the acidity of pineapple.
*   **Kiwi:** They share the same sour-sweet flavor profile.

**Texture:**

*   **Peach:** Canned peaches, especially, have a similar texture to pineapple.
*   **Some pear varieties:** Bosc pears, when ripe, have a slightly grainy texture that could be reminiscent of pineapple.

**Overall Similarity (Combination of factors):**

*   **Golden Berries (Cape Gooseberries):** These small fruits have a sweet, tangy flavor with tropical notes that some people find similar to pineapple.
*   **Ugli fruit (Tangelo):** A citrus fruit hybrid (tangerine x grapefruit), this can have a taste that hints at pineapple with its sour-sweet flavor.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Ripeness:** The ripeness of each fruit greatly affects its flavor. An underripe mango won't have the same sweetness as a ripe one, and a ripe pineapple will be much sweeter and less acidic than an unripe one.
*   **Variety:** Different varieties within each fruit type can vary greatly in taste and texture.
*   **Personal Preference:** Taste is subjective, so what one person finds similar, another may not.

In conclusion, **mango** is probably the closest overall to pineapple in flavor and acidity, but **golden berries** and **guava** are also good candidates. The degree of similarity is largely dependent on the variety and ripeness of the fruits.
