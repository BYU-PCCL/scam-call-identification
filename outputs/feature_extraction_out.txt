[Your Name] aims to ensure everyone can learn and grow, regardless of their starting point., \nThat sounds perfect. What's the registration process? [Step: 3] You can register through our website. I can guide you through the steps if you'd like, or send you a direct link to the registration page., \nA direct link would be great. Can you also tell me about the workshop fee? [Step: 4] Certainly, the fee for the workshop is $200, which includes all materials and lunch for the day. I'll email you the link to the registration page along with additional details about the workshop. May I have your email address?, \nSure, it's sam.photography@example.com. [Step: 5] Thank you, Sam.
